# Automated-Excel-Reporting

This script enables an automated excel report. First, raw data is imported, then the needed columns (e.g. sales, customer-region etc.) is extracted. After that,
a PivotTable is created. Then with openpyxl package, excel formulars can be written. At last, a barchart is created and the report is exported as a excel file.

Used packages:
- string (for creating column alphabet chars A,B,C ...)
- openpyxl (for writing excel formulars)
-
